# Business Cases

## Introduction

Every prior file in this module taught one concept in isolation. Real reporting work never asks for just one — it asks for a full KPI report combining several aggregates at once, across a real business domain. This file closes the module by walking through complete, realistic reporting scenarios end to end.

## Learning Objectives

- Combine `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and conditional aggregation in single, realistic queries
- Read a business question and translate it directly into the correct combination of clauses
- Recognize the shape of the queries that sit behind real BI dashboards

## Concept Overview

A single well-formed business report query typically layers:

```
SELECT   <grouping column(s)>, <aggregate 1>, <aggregate 2>, ...
FROM     <base table>
JOIN     <related tables as needed>
WHERE    <row-level filters, applied before grouping>
GROUP BY <grouping column(s)>
HAVING   <group-level filters, applied after aggregation>
ORDER BY <most useful sort for the audience>
```

This file works through that shape across five business domains, using the schema already established in this module.

## Schema Used

Same as the rest of the module: `employes(emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, manager_id, salary)`, `departments(dept_id, dept_name, location_id)`, `locations(location_id, city)`.

## Business Domain: HR — Department Scorecard

**Business question:** "For each department with more than one employee, show headcount, average salary, salary range, and the split between employees earning above and below $50,000 — sorted by headcount, largest first."

This single question requires `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and conditional aggregation together — see `08_BUSINESS_CASES.sql` Q1 for the full query.

## Business Domain: Workforce Planning — City Capacity Report

**Business question:** "How many employees work in each city, and what's the average salary there? Only show cities with at least 2 employees, since smaller sites don't need a dedicated facilities review."

This is the canonical "3-table join + GROUP BY + HAVING" pattern established across the module, now applied as a real deliverable. See `08_BUSINESS_CASES.sql` Q2.

## Business Domain: Compensation — Pay Equity Check

**Business question:** "Which departments have a pay-band spread (max minus min salary) greater than $15,000? This might indicate inconsistent role scoping that needs review before the next compensation cycle."

See `08_BUSINESS_CASES.sql` Q3 — this reuses the `MAX() - MIN()` derived-aggregate pattern from `04_MIN_MAX.sql`, filtered with `HAVING`.

## Business Domain: Org Design — Manager Span of Control

**Business question:** "Which managers have more than one direct report, and what's the average salary of their team?"

See `08_BUSINESS_CASES.sql` Q4 — this reuses the multi-column `GROUP BY dept_id, manager_id` pattern from `05_GROUP_BY.sql`, generalized to span-of-control analysis.

## Business Domain: Executive Summary — Single-Row Company KPIs

**Business question:** "Give me one row: total headcount, total payroll, average salary, and the highest single salary in the company — for the executive dashboard header."

See `08_BUSINESS_CASES.sql` Q5 — a no-`GROUP BY` query, the entire table treated as one implicit group, demonstrating that everything learned in this module works even without an explicit grouping column.

## Engineering Notes

- Real business questions rarely name the SQL clause they need — "show me departments *with more than* one employee" is a `HAVING` clause in disguise; "only for Nagpur" is a `WHERE` clause in disguise. Translating business language into the row-filter-vs-group-filter distinction is the actual skill this module builds.
- Always order the final result set for the audience that will read it — an executive wants the biggest numbers first; an operations team scanning for problems wants the worst outliers first.
- When a report combines many aggregates, add a raw `COUNT(*)` alongside averages so the reader can judge how much weight to give each row (a department average over 1 person carries far less signal than one over 50).

## Best Practices

- Build these queries incrementally: start with the `SELECT ... FROM ... JOIN` skeleton and confirm the row-level data looks right *before* adding `GROUP BY`. Debugging a wrong aggregate on top of a wrong join is much harder than debugging either alone.
- Name every aggregate column for its business meaning (`avg_department_salary`), never leave it as the literal function call in output meant for a report or API response.
- When a `HAVING` threshold is a business rule (e.g., "$50,000", "more than 1 employee"), treat it as a parameter, not a hardcoded literal, the moment this query leaves an exploratory notebook and enters production code.

## Interview Questions

1. Given the plain-English request "show me cities with more than 2 employees and their average salary," identify every SQL clause you'd need, in order.
2. Why might a report need `COUNT(*)` alongside `AVG()` even if the business only asked for the average?
3. Design (in words, no SQL required) the query shape for: "top 3 departments by total payroll, among departments with at least 3 employees."

## Summary

Real reporting work is rarely a single aggregate function in isolation — it's `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`/`MAX`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and conditional aggregation composed together to answer one specific business question. This file is the bridge between "I know what `SUM()` does" and "I can write the query behind an actual dashboard."

## Practice Challenges

1. Build the HR Department Scorecard query yourself before checking `08_BUSINESS_CASES.sql` Q1.
2. Extend the City Capacity Report to also show the highest single salary per city.
3. Write the query for: "departments where the average salary exceeds the company-wide average salary" (hint: this needs a subquery — a preview of Module 04).
