# Module 02 — Aggregations

## Introduction

Aggregation is where SQL stops answering "what are the rows" and starts answering "what do the rows mean." Every dashboard tile, every KPI, every executive summary in every company that uses a relational database is, underneath, an aggregation query. This module builds that skill from `COUNT(*)` up to full multi-clause business reports.

## Why Aggregations Matter

Raw rows are not insight. "Here are 50,000 order records" tells a business nothing actionable. "Total revenue this month is $2.4M, up 12% from last month, driven mainly by the Nagpur region" — that sentence is entirely the output of `SUM`, `GROUP BY`, and comparison logic. Aggregation is the layer that turns data into decisions.

## Business Motivation

Every function in this module maps directly to a question a real business asks daily:

| Business Question | SQL Concept |
|---|---|
| "How many customers do we have?" | `COUNT()` |
| "What's our total revenue?" | `SUM()` |
| "What's our average order value?" | `AVG()` |
| "What was our biggest sale? Our smallest?" | `MIN()` / `MAX()` |
| "Break that down by region." | `GROUP BY` |
| "Only show regions above $1M." | `HAVING` |
| "Show active vs. inactive counts side by side." | Conditional Aggregation |

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Choose correctly between `COUNT(*)`, `COUNT(column)`, and `COUNT(DISTINCT column)`
- Compute totals and averages while correctly reasoning about `NULL` behavior
- Find extremes (`MIN`/`MAX`) across numeric, date, and text columns
- Collapse row-level data into per-category summaries with `GROUP BY`
- Filter those summaries with `HAVING`, and know precisely when to use `HAVING` vs. `WHERE`
- Pivot category values into side-by-side metrics using conditional aggregation
- Compose all of the above into realistic, multi-clause business reports

## Prerequisites

Completion of **Module 01 — Fundamentals** (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN` basics) and familiarity with the module's schema (below). No prior aggregation knowledge assumed.

## Module Structure

## Functions Covered

`COUNT()` · `COUNT(DISTINCT)` · `SUM()` · `AVG()` · `MIN()` · `MAX()` · `GROUP BY` (single- and multi-column) · `HAVING` · `CASE WHEN` inside aggregates · PostgreSQL `FILTER (WHERE ...)`

## Schema Used Throughout This Module

```
employes                    departments               locations
┌─────────────┐             ┌─────────────┐           ┌──────────────┐
│ emp_id (PK) │             │ dept_id (PK)│           │ location_id  │
│ emp_name    │             │ dept_name   │           │      (PK)    │
│ dept_id (FK)│────────────▶│ location_id │──────────▶│ city         │
│ manager_id  │             │      (FK)   │           └──────────────┘
│ salary      │
└─────────────┘
```

*(Note: the `employes` spelling is used consistently across this repository's seed data and is preserved here rather than "corrected," to avoid breaking cross-references to existing queries.)*

## Aggregation Pipeline (Execution Order)

This is the single most important diagram in the module — internalize it before moving on:

```
FROM   → the base table(s) and JOINs
WHERE  → filter individual ROWS (before any grouping happens)
GROUP BY → collapse rows into per-category groups
HAVING → filter GROUPS, based on aggregated values
SELECT → compute and return final columns
ORDER BY → sort the final result set
```

A condition on a raw column (`dept_id = 10`) belongs in `WHERE`. A condition on an aggregate result (`COUNT(*) > 5`) belongs in `HAVING`. Mixing these up is the most common aggregation bug in production SQL.

## Business Domains Covered

HR (headcount, payroll) · Workforce Planning (city/site capacity) · Compensation (pay-band analysis) · Org Design (manager span of control) · Executive Reporting (single-row KPI summaries) — see [`08_BUSINESS_CASES.md`](./08_BUSINESS_CASES.md) for full worked examples in each.

## Engineering Workflow

1. Confirm the base `SELECT ... FROM ... JOIN` returns the correct rows *before* adding any aggregate function.
2. Decide what one output row should represent (e.g. "one row per department") — this determines your `GROUP BY` columns.
3. Add aggregates to the `SELECT` list, aliasing every one with a business-meaningful name.
4. Add `WHERE` for row-level filters, `HAVING` for group-level filters — never mix the two up.
5. `ORDER BY` for the audience reading the output.

## Performance Considerations

- Prefer `WHERE` over `HAVING` whenever a condition can be expressed on raw columns — filtering rows early reduces how much data needs to be grouped and aggregated.
- `MIN()`/`MAX()` with no `GROUP BY` on an indexed column can often be answered via a single index seek rather than a full scan.
- `COUNT(*)` is not slower than `COUNT(1)` in any mainstream engine — this is a persistent myth. Use whichever is clearer; this repository standardizes on `COUNT(*)`.
- Grouping on high-cardinality columns (e.g. a primary key) produces one group per row — usually a sign the query shouldn't be using `GROUP BY` at all.

## Common Mistakes (Module-Wide)

- Confusing `COUNT(column)` (skips `NULL`) with `COUNT(*)` (counts every row).
- Forgetting that `SUM()`/`AVG()`/`MIN()`/`MAX()` all return `NULL` — not `0` — on an empty or all-`NULL` group.
- Averaging pre-aggregated averages across groups of unequal size instead of recomputing from raw rows.
- Writing an aggregate function inside `WHERE` instead of `HAVING`.
- Using `WHERE` to filter to one category when the goal is to compute *multiple* category metrics side by side (that's a job for conditional aggregation).

## Best Practices

- Always alias aggregate columns for their business meaning.
- Surface `COUNT(*)` alongside any `AVG()` so readers can judge statistical weight.
- Treat `HAVING` thresholds and `CASE WHEN` boundaries as business parameters, not hardcoded literals, once a query leaves exploratory work.
- Know the execution order (`FROM → WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING → SELECT → ORDER BY`) well enough to place every condition in the right clause without guessing.

## Interview Preparation

This module's `.md` files each end with a targeted interview-question set. The three most frequently asked aggregation interview questions, module-wide:

1. **"What's the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`?"** — Covered in depth in [`06_HAVING.md`](./06_HAVING.md).
2. **"Why does `COUNT(*)` return 0 on an empty table, but `SUM()` returns `NULL`?"** — Covered in [`01_COUNT.md`](./01_COUNT.md) and [`02_SUM.md`](./02_SUM.md).
3. **"How would you get counts for two different conditions in one query row?"** — Covered in [`07_CONDITIONAL_AGGREGATION.md`](./07_CONDITIONAL_AGGREGATION.md).

## Career Relevance

Aggregation queries are asked in nearly every SQL technical screen, regardless of company or seniority level, because they test both syntax knowledge and the ability to translate a business question into precise, correctly-ordered SQL clauses — exactly the skill this module is built around.

## Estimated Time

4–6 hours for a first pass through all 8 files, including practice challenges.

## Difficulty

Beginner → Intermediate (Files 01–06: Beginner. Files 07–08: Intermediate, and the natural bridge into Module 12's advanced aggregation techniques.)
