FROM employees
GROUP BY dept_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```
----------------

INNER JOIN

Returns matching records from both tables.
```
SELECT *
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d
ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```
----------------

LEFT JOIN

Returns all rows from left table and matching from right .
```
SELECT *
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d
ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
